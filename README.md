# Roomba-Robot
Roomba robot for UCF Robotics project
Uses gmapping and RVIZ to map its area and plot a course through the house, main models are from the turtlebot3 tutorials but with slight edits by me using blender. 
Slow laptop caused issues with lag, unfortunately couldn't record the whole process.

Unfortunately original code was corrupted so I have to remake it
