# Roomba-Robot
Roomba robot for UCF Robotics project

Simulated in Gazebo, uses gmapping and RVIZ to map its area and plot a course through the house, main models are from the turtlebot3 tutorials but with slight edits by me using blender. Unfortunately the original code was corrupted so I have to remake it.

Snippet of the robot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXHgaU5JRkI my laptop wasn't powerful enough so the simulation was having lag issues, unfortunately couldn't record the whole process.
