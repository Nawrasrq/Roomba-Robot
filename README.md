# Trashbot
Roomba robot for a UCF Robotics project

Simulated in Gazebo, uses gmapping and RVIZ to map its area and plot a course through the house, model is from the turtlebot3 tutorials but with slight edits by me using blender. Unfortunately the original code was corrupted so I am currently in the process of remaking it.

Updates
  - Uses Ubuntu Jammy 22.04, ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress (developed in an Ubuntu VM using Oracle VM virtual box manager)
  - Renamed the robot to trashbot (Was Roomba-Robot)
  - Modeled the code structure and hierarchy after the [Turtlebot3 repo](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3/tree/humble-devel) and their lidar sensor

Unfortunately at the time I only had a laptop that wasn't powerful enough to run the simulation so I could only record a snippet before the simulation lags and crashes
